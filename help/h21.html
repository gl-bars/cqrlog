            Backup your data often! BACKUP your log directory at the end of EVERY session!
            All that you need to backup and store in a safe place is the log database directory
            located in the ~/.config/cqrlog/database folder, or you can enable the autobackup function
            in Preferences. This autobackup function creates an ADIF file with a backup of your log.

There are two basic options - web cluster and the usual DX cluster with
telnet options. The web cluster method is good for monitoring. There is no
internal node setup, but you can't spot. CQRLOG downloads the spots at
regular intervals, the interval is fixed and cannot be changed.
<br><br>Telnet cluster is fully featured. You can also set up your
preferences on the node. The Command line box is used for all commands,
settings etc. with one exception - the Tilde key (~) is used for spotting.
The color coding and spot filtering is set up in the
<a href="h1.html#ah11"><b>Preferences menu</b></a>. <strong>Connect</strong> to the
cluster node by simply clicking the 'Connect' button. You should see the cluster node
messages indicating progress. You can enter any command into the 'Command' field
(ie. SH/DX to display last spots, SH/U to see the users connected to the node etc.).

            <strong><font color="blue">Our tip:</font></strong> For a nice looking cluster window,
            choose a fixed-width font. We prefer Monospace Regular or Onuava but also Courier works
            nicely. Apple's Monaco font is also very nice and has a slashed zero.

                Both address and port number can be obtained from the lists of DX cluster

            <img src="img/h64.png" border="0"></td>
        <td valign="top">
            <div align="justify"><br><br>
                The main purpose of a bandmap is to combine the most interesting info from two sources - the DX
                Cluster and your personal notes. The bandmap combines a DX Cluster window with scratch
                pad memories available on many radios, however a band map is more comfortable by far - you
                don't need to manipulate subtle buttons on the radio panel, also the transceiver does
                not indicate what is in the scratch pad memory. The band map is operated from the keyboard
                and shows all at a glance.
                <br><br>A valuable addition is the 'entries aging' option. If the bandmap entry is 'too' old,
                it changes color and after another period it disappears. This is different from the usual
                DX Cluster windows which display details of stations you have already worked, that are QRT
                or are not very interesting to you from another reason. A band map provides frequency-sorted
                and highly filtered details which don't scroll away (like the DX Cluster window does).
                There are two levels of filtering:
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>Spot filtering set up for the DX Cluster window</li>
                <li>Additional band map filtering capable of filtering out spots from momentarily unwanted
                    modes, contries, zones or continents. CQRLOG has another filter allowing you to watch spots
                    of special interest, ie. you are waiting for an expedition etc. You can set up another
                    filter showing spots only on the active band (the band which the radio is on) and the
                    actual mode (the mode the radio is on).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div align="justify">You can add your own information by writing the call into the logging
                screen in the usual way (like logging). Then press <strong>Ctrl-A</strong> and the entry
                will be added to the band map. Your own entries are marked with an asterisk (here MD0CCE).
                You can return to the frequency anytime, the call will jump into its box in the same way
                as if clicked from the DX Cluster window. Click on any entry, you are on, prepared for
                QSO logging.<br><br>
                If the entry becomes older than the set time, it is displayed in a lighter color. Very old
                entries will disappear, also if you log the station, the corresponding entry disappears
                from the band map. The entries are always sorted by frequency.

            CQRLOG provides virtually unlimited support for additional notes which can be attached
            to a particular callsign (ie. an electronic QSL, a map showing the position, text files
            with antenna details etc). Assuming that external viewers for the text, PDF, image
            (jpg, png, gif) and HTML files are <a href="h1.html#ch4">set up properly</a>, all these
            files can be displayed.<br><br>
            The main program tree contains the <strong>call_data</strong> subfolder where any callsign
            can have its own subfolder containing the files related to the call sign. The subfolder
            for a call sign must be created manually. If this subfolder exists, a special icon "Call
            has an attachment" appears at the bottom right corner of the <em>Comment to callsign</em>
            field in the main logging screen. Click this icon and another window
            <strong>Call attachment</strong> appears, showing the contents of the call sign subfolder.
            Highlight the file you want to view and either double click or use the View button to display
            the file. The number of call sign related subfolders in <strong>call_data</strong> is
            unlimited, also the call sign related subfolder may contain any number of files.

            appears showing the front of the QSL card. The "qsl_call_front.png" or "qsl_call_front.jpg"
            <strong>is mandatory</strong> but there can also be a reverse side of QSL card with the
            name "qsl_call_back.png" or "qsl_call_back.jpg". If this file is available, you can use
            the "Front" and "Back" tabs to display both sides of the QSL card.<br><br>
